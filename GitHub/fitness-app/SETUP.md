## PART 1 — SET UP GOOGLE SHEETS SYNC (10 min)

### Step 1 — Create a new Google Sheet
1. Go to **sheets.google.com** on any browser
2. Click the big **+** button to create a blank spreadsheet
3. Name it **WemyssWorkouts** (click "Untitled spreadsheet" at the top)

### Step 2 — Open Apps Script
1. In your Google Sheet, click **Extensions** in the top menu
2. Click **Apps Script**
3. A new tab will open with a code editor

### Step 3 — Paste the script
1. Delete everything currently in the editor (Ctrl+A then Delete)
2. Open the file **apps-script.gs** from this folder in any text editor (Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on Mac)
3. Copy everything (Ctrl+A then Ctrl+C)
4. Paste it into the Apps Script editor (Ctrl+V)

### Step 4 — Set your secret API key
1. In the script, find this line near the top:
   ```
   var API_KEY = 'CHANGE_THIS_TO_YOUR_SECRET_KEY';
   ```
2. Replace **CHANGE_THIS_TO_YOUR_SECRET_KEY** with something memorable, e.g.:
   ```
   var API_KEY = 'WemyssW2026';
   ```
   Write this down — you'll need it later.

## TROUBLESHOOTING

**App won't install on iPhone:**
- Make sure you're using Safari (not Chrome or Firefox) on iPhone
- Make sure the app has fully loaded before tapping Share

**Sync not working:**
- Double-check the URL — it must start with `https://script.google.com/macros/s/`
- Make sure the API key in the app matches exactly what's in the script (case sensitive)
- Check you're connected to the internet
- In Apps Script: click Deploy → Manage deployments → make sure "Anyone" has access

**Data is gone after phone restart:**
- This shouldn't happen, but if it does: go to Sync → Send All Historical Data to Sheets, then rebuild from there
- This is why the Google Sheets backup exists

**"Error: Unauthorized" in sync:**
- Your API key doesn't match. Re-check Step 4 and Part 5.

## HOW SYNCING WORKS

- Every time you log a session, it saves to your phone first (works offline)
- When you're online, it automatically sends to Google Sheets in the background
- If you were offline, it syncs as soon as you open the app with internet
- Google Sheets is your permanent backup — the app is your daily interface

---

## YOUR GOOGLE SHEET TABS

After syncing, your sheet will have:
- **Strength** — Every set from every session (date, exercise, weight, reps, volume)
- **Cardio** — Every cardio session (distance, HR, pace, kcal, effort)
- **Cardio Splits** — Per-kilometre data from each cardio session
- **Biofeedback** — Weekly check-in scores (logged from the Plan screen)
